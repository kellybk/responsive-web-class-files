				<h2>I live in Barrie, Ontario. I'm originally from London, Ontario. I love London and I try to get back to visit family whenever I can. I enjoy keeping fit and healthy. I love to travel when I get the chance. I enjoy listening to comedy and educational podcasts. I love science and science fiction. One of my favorite places to be is at the cinema. My favorite colours are purple and blue. I love animals and have 2 cats named Scully and Mulder.
			
				<br>I love everything about NASA and the space program. Check out some of my favourite quotes below.</h2>

                <p>Space is for everybody. It's not just for a few people in science or math, or for a select group of astronauts. That's our new frontier out there, and it's everybody's business to know about space.

			<div id="div-2" class="flex-items">
                <p>I believe that space travel will one day become as common as airline travel is today. I'm convinced, however, that the true future of space travel does not lie with government agencies -- NASA is still obsessed with the idea that the primary purpose of the space program is science -- but real progress will come from private companies competing to provide the ultimate adventure ride, and NASA will receive the trickle-down benefits.

                <p>We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win.
